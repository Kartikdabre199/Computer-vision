# CCONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK
A CNN is a supervised learning technique which needs both input data and target output data to be supplied. These are classified by using their labels in order to provide a learned model for future data analysis.
Typically a CNN has three main constituents - a Convolutional Layer, a Pooling Layer and a Fully connected Dense Network. The Convolutional layer takes the input image and applies m number of nxn filters to receive a feature map. The feature map is next fed into the max pool layer which is essentially used for dimensionality reduction, it picks only the best features from the feature map. Finally, all the features are flattened and sent as input to the fully connected dense neural network which learns the weights using backpropagation and provides the classification output.
## Mask and No Mask prediction using cnn 
### Problem statement
The objective is to classify the images specifically person is wearing a mask or not using keras and cnn

## Male and Female classification using cnn
### Problem statement
The objective is to classify the person is male or the female using cnn and keras .
